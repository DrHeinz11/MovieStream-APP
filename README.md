## Technologies
I used `React.Js`,`Redux Tollkit`, `RTK Query`,`ChakraUI` ...

## Setup
- Download or clone the repository
- Install dependecies : `yarn install`
- Run : `yarn run dev`
- Build : `yarn run build`
- Build Preview : `yarn run preview`

## Approach
I used the react js framework to create each of the functional components for the app, the styling was applied using the ChakraUi style library, I used both react context Api and rxjs to control the data and interactions of the functionalities. 
Since chakra has a deficit with the elements that use clipPath use a .css stylesheet to make up for that deficit and get to the proposed design.
The data feaching is done with redux tollkit query which provides specific methods for retrieving information from API and provides a cache system, The data is stored in the redux tollkit store and is provided in the form of a global status for the entire application.
## Status
[MovieStreamAPP] is still in progress. `Version 1.0.5` will be out soon.
